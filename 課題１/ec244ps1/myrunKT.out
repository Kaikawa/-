Start estimation
The negative of the log-likelihood is minimized,
which is the same as maximizing the log-likelihood.

You can access the estimated parameters as variable paramhat,
the gradient of the negative of the log-likelihood function as variable grad,
the hessian of the negative of the log-likelihood function as variable hessian,
and the inverse of the hessian as variable ihess.
The hessian is calculated by the BFGS updating procedure.
