The results of this problem set are discussed as part of the lecture entitled "Nested Logit." This discussion will assist you in understanding how the code is changed for each exercise.

Exercises 1, 6, 7 use files job1.txt, job2.txt, job3.txt, which were included in the problem set. 
Exercise 2 is a simple change to job1.txt. 

Exercises 3-5 can be done with the following files, each of which is a modification of job1.txt:

ktjob1.txt does exercise 3. The output file is ktout1.txt.

ktjob1a.txt does exercise 4. The output file is ktout1a.txt.

ktjob1b.txt does exercise 5. The output file is ktout1b.txt.

Exercise 8 can be done with ktjob3a.txt, which is a modification of job3.txt. The output is in ktout3a.txt.
